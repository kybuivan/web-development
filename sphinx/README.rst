========================
Sphinx Template
========================

This is a template project that utilizes Sphinx to generate documentation and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The project is styled using the ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` theme.

Getting Started
===============

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python (3.6 or above)
- pip package manager

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository:

::

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Change into the project directory:

::

    cd your-repo

3. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

::

    python3 -m venv env

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Linux/macOS:

   ::

       source env/bin/activate

   On Windows:

   ::

       .\env\Scripts\activate

5. Install the required dependencies:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Building the Documentation
==========================

To build the documentation locally, run the following command:

::

    make html

The generated HTML files will be stored in the ``docs/_build/html`` directory.

Previewing the Documentation
============================

To preview the generated documentation locally, open the ``index.html`` file located in ``docs/_build/html`` with your preferred web browser.

Deploying to GitHub Pages
=========================

1. Open the ``docs/conf.py`` file and modify the ``html_baseurl`` variable to match your repository name:

::

    html_baseurl = 'https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/'

2. Commit the changes:

::

    git commit -am "Update documentation configuration"

3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:

::

    git push origin master

4. Enable GitHub Pages for the ``docs`` folder:

- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Settings" in the top-right menu.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Select the ``gh-pages`` branch as the source.
- Click "Save".

After a few moments, your documentation will be available at ``https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/``.

Customization
=============

- Edit the Sphinx configuration in ``docs/conf.py`` to tailor the documentation to your project's needs.
- Modify the contents of the ``docs/source`` directory to include your project's documentation.
